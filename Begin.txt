status conditions for pokemon 
partial render - slowpoke without tail
proxy - substitute

Some pokemon do not have a gender

might be cool to add in the pokedex what nature is "best" and what berries the pokemon will like eating due to it's nature

give trainers the option to note if a pokemon has been EV trained? 

traded? radio button 
would have to toggle trainer_id and captured_by_id, put in a timestamp for when the trading occured
